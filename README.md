# Fitness Center Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project addresses customer churn concerns for a fitness center’s Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). The goal was to analyze customer behavior, identify patterns leading to churn, and build a predictive model to assist in strategic retention decisions. This solution provides actionable insights and a machine learning model that forecasts customer churn, equipping the fitness center to take proactive steps in improving retention.

## Problem Statement
The fitness center’s CMO is concerned about customer churn, which affects business growth and revenue. The objective was to:
1. Analyze the provided customer data to uncover factors driving customer attrition.
2. Develop a predictive model to forecast which customers are at risk of churning.
3. Deliver findings in a formal proposal that includes insights and data-backed recommendations tailored to the fitness industry’s needs.

## Project Structure
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** A thorough analysis of the customer data to understand key variables and identify trends associated with churn. This step included summary statistics, visualizations, and variable correlation analysis.
  
- **Model Selection and Development:** Based on the EDA insights, an appropriate machine learning model was selected, developed, and fine-tuned to predict churn. Model performance was carefully evaluated to ensure accuracy and reliability for the client’s use case.

- **Insights and Recommendations:** Extracted actionable insights from the model to suggest data-driven interventions for reducing churn. Findings were presented in a client-friendly format with visualizations and a clear interpretation of results.

## Key Files
- `data/`: Contains the processed fitness center data used for analysis and modeling.
- `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the exploratory data analysis steps and visualizations.
