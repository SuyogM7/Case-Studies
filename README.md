# Fitness Center Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

Project Overview
This project was conducted to address the customer churn concerns of a fitness center’s Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). The objective was to analyze customer behavior, identify patterns that lead to churn, and build a predictive model to help the fitness center make informed retention decisions. The solution was designed to provide actionable insights and a machine learning model that predicts customer churn, assisting in strategic interventions for improved retention.

Problem Statement
The fitness center’s CMO expressed concerns about customer churn and its impact on business growth and revenue. The goal was to analyze customer data provided by the fitness center, identify the main factors driving customer attrition, and develop a predictive model to forecast churn. The final deliverable also included a formal proposal outlining findings, data-driven insights, and actionable recommendations tailored to the client’s needs.

Project Structure
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the provided customer data to understand key variables and identify trends associated with churn. The EDA included summary statistics, data visualizations, and analysis of variable correlations.

Model Selection and Development: Based on the insights from EDA, an appropriate machine learning model was identified, developed, and fine-tuned to predict churn probability. Model performance was evaluated to ensure reliability and accuracy for the client's use case.

Insights and Recommendations: Generated insights from the model outputs to suggest data-driven actions to reduce churn. Presented findings in a clear, client-friendly format, including visualizations and interpretation of the model results.
